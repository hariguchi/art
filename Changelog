2001-06-12  1.0  Released
2001-09-15  1.1  Fixed bug that wrongly reports that the
                 destination IP address is not included in the
                 matched prefix
2001-12-30  1.2  Fixed bug: init value of `i' in rtArtPcDeleteRoute()
2015-07-05  1.3  Added a lot of comments. Started moving the
                 code to GitHub
2015-07-09  1.4  Added exact route match function.
2015-07-10  1.5  Fixed bugs in rtArtPcFindMatch(). It is
                 necessary to do bit string comparison in the
                 case of path compressed trie (no need to do so
                 in the case of simple trie.)
2015-07-10  1.6  Modified IPv6 test to support up to /128 routes.
2015-07-17  1.7  Added support for >8 bit stride length subtables to
                 path-compressed trie
2016-08-22  1.8  Added the following features:
                  1. Flush Routes: This feature deletes all the
                     routes from the routing table.
                  2. Delete Routing Table: This feature first
                     delete all the routes by calling flush
                     route function, then delete the routing
                     table itself and free its memory.
